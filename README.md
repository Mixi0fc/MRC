**Here's a mini Q&A**

My bot does not starts

- Try enabling all the intents on your bot page:
- ![image](https://github.com/Mixigamer1232/MRC/assets/86746636/a143cb2f-971f-42e5-9c22-edecc17ea4b4)
- Do you installed the packages? try running "pip install -r requirements.txt" on the code's directory.
- You're using the right token?


Where I find my server ID?

- You can find it on your server settings, on the DEBUG INFORMATION section.


Where do I find my API KEY?

- You can create it on your "Account Settigs" page, on the "API Credentials" section. Create an api key, the name and the description does not matter. **DO NOT SHARE IT**

Where do I find my panel link?

- Seriusly? It's the link that you use to access the host. For example: [https://panel.infiniteram.ru/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- You have to add https:// or http:// on your link. Coppy it from your hosting's main page and paste it
